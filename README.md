## Mariana's project for Coyotiv Software Engineering Course

### Now from a template with Express js

&nbsp;

---

This project is a learning exercise, as part of my Course on Software Engineering at Coyotiv (2022).
It is not a finished application and is deprecated once the learning goals have been achieved. This is why you wonâ€™t find any meaningful feature and why things may be breaking ;-)

I am surely learning loads though!

### Learning goal of this stage:

Express JS and Pug, using nodemon.
